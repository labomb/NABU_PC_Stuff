# NABU PC Stuff

This is a small collection of miscellaneous utilities and other things that I've hacked together for the NABU PC.

## Patched boot ROM version 14

This is the 'do it all' ROM that many use because of it's versatility. It can load the standard software cycles, custom apps, homebrew apps, and can also boot floppy disks as well as the NABU hard drive (should you actually have one!). See the ROM version 14 folder for additional details.

## Homebrew apps

Most of the NABU server software applications available include the ability to load so-called 'homebrew' applications. Please refer to your specific server documentation for details on how to do so.

#### Boot Floppy

This utility is simple, but useful for those of you who have a floppy controller. Simply insert a bootable floppy disk into drive A, and load this app from your server. If the disk is a valid NABU compatible CP/M disk, it will boot.

#### Nascom BASIC

This homebrew app is the popular Z80 Nascom BASIC specifically customized to run on the NABU PC. This is an adaptation of the original found on Grant Searle's excellent web site found [here](http://searle.x10host.com/z80/SimpleZ80.html#RomFiles).

## Miscellaneous

The 3d printable STL file is a blank slot cover for the NABU PC. It's easy to drill or otherwise modify to accommodate various switches, connectors, etc..., without having to modify/damage your original steel slot covers.

# Bug reports, feedback, etc...

>**Please Note:**
 I cannot provide general support for the NABU PC, it's usage, or issues that you may have with it. Accordingly, I ask that you please not post anything relative to general usage/issues/questions here. There are several other venues for these types of questions, including websites, forums, and a Discord server. Thanks!
